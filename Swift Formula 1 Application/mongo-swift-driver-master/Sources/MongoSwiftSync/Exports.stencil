// Re-export various types from MongoSwift that are also used in the API for MongoSwiftSync. We start out with all of
// the types in MongoSwift, and then filter out types that are not public, that are explicitly annotated with
// "skipSyncExport" (this is used to mark types that are async-specific) and types whose definitions are nested within
// other types. We don't need to explicitly re-export nested types as re-exporting their parent types will make them
// available under their parents' namespaces, just as they are in the async module.

{% for type in types.all|public|!annotated:"skipSyncExport" where type.parent == nil %}
@_exported import {{ type.kind }} MongoSwift.{{ type.name }}
{% endfor %}

// Protocols are not included in the types list, so we list them separately here.
{% for protocol in types.protocols|public %}
@_exported import protocol MongoSwift.{{ protocol.name }}
{% endfor %}

// Manually add typealiases
@_exported import typealias MongoSwift.InsertManyOptions
@_exported import typealias MongoSwift.ServerErrorCode

// Manually add cleanup method
